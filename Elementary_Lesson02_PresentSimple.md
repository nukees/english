# __02. Present simple__

The positive form of the present simple only changes after he/she/it:  

__Singular__  
I stop              
You stop  
He/She/It stops

__Plural__  
We stop  
You stop  
They stop

But for verbs ending in __-o__, __-ch__, __-sh__, __-ss__ and __-x__, we add __-es__   
__(b,c,d и др. согласные) + y__ -> __ies__  
__have__ -> __has__
